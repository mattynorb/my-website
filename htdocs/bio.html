    <h2>What I'm Doing Here </h2>
    <p>I'm a lad who is currently studying computing at the University of Northampton. I currently study six modules which are Web Development, Software Engineering, problem solving&Programming, Computer Communication, Computer Systems and Databases.</p>
    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>I traveled to Northampton for university from The Wirral. Most people haven't heard of The Wirral so I just mainly tell them I'm from Liverpool - which I get away with because of my scouse like accent. Liverpool is quite well known for many things.
        For example Liverpool is probably most famously know as the birth place of The Beatles - a fantasting band that were formed in the 1960s. Liverpool is also well known for their football teams and the football fanatics who live their; it's rare
        to find someone in Liverpool who doesn't follow at least one football team!</p>
    <h2>My Experience of University Life So Far</h2>
    <p>To sum it up I've really enjoyed university so far. Now for the longer answer. Before coming to university I had times where I was excited to go and times when I was a little unsure of how it's going to go. Luckily in the first day I met three members
        of the 5 that live with me in my flat and we sat around, introduced ourselves and then got on with the typical university experience; we started drinking! So I found out that most of my flat mates were a good bunch that night (the other two I
        still hadn't seen). From there on out it's gone no where but up and I hope it continues that waythroughout.</p>
    <h2>What I Like To Do</h2>
    <p>I love playing rugby, it's extremely fun and keeps me in good shape! I played for my local team for four years now and play when I visit home for the holidays. I'm looking to join the universities team but need to find the time to do so (after I've
        completed my assignments). I also enjoy traveling, whether it be somewhere local or somewhere that is a distance away; if I haven't been there, I want to be there. I also like to play games on my PC in my free time, the games I like to play the
        most are Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.</p>
    <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm 19 years old and have ginger hair. I have two brothers and three sisters, most of which have moved out. When it comes to pets I would most prefer to have a dog over anything else, although I've never owned one. I have, however, owned a gerbil,
        a bearded dragon and have pretty much owned a kitten since my sister never looked after it leaving it to me to look after it. In school the subject I enjoyed the most was Comuter Science (Computing) I also enjoyed science a lot, especially Physics.
        In my life so far I have sprained my right ankle three times, dislocated my shoulder twice and broken two of my ribs.</p>
